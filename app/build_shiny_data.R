# build_shiny_data.R - refresh the AD Loci Explorer table from a pipeline release.
#
#   Rscript build_shiny_data.R <release_dir> [out.csv]
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS IS A JOIN AND NOT A REBUILD
#
# The explorer's table mixes three kinds of column, with three different origins:
#
#   (A) LOCUS / VARIANT   - ADlocus, variant_ID, rsID, chr, pos, cV2F, p-values,
#                           GWAS sources. Produced by the integration pipeline and
#                           refreshed from the release. SAFE TO REGENERATE.
#
#   (B) TIER              - top_confidence (T1-T5). NOT produced by the pipeline.
#                           Tier assignment is a downstream gene-prioritization step
#                           the locus-level build script that
#                           no release carries. Joined from a preserved reference.
#
#   (C) GENE-LEVEL        - trans_*, ct_*, context, n_contexts, TWAS/MR/cTWAS flags.
#                           Also from the downstream script. Carried forward by gene.
#
# Regenerating this table from the release alone would silently blank every (B) and
# (C) column and drop any gene whose only support is gene-level rather than localized
# (EPHX2 is the worked example). So (A) refreshes, (B) and (C) are joined, and every
# row records where its evidence came from.
#
# A FULL refresh of (C) requires re-running the downstream prioritization script on
# the new release. This script does not attempt that; it reports the gap instead.

## Five of those six are app columns, refreshed from the release in (C2). The
## sixth, the CCA program count, has no app column of its own and is read here
## rather than added, so the drift check does not see an unreferenced column.
##
## Not derived from Method == 'trans_finemapping': that is how gene_prio_utils.R
## builds it upstream, but the exported table drops the trans rows and keeps
## only their summaries, so applying it here yields FALSE everywhere.
##
## Against the carried column this agrees on 3,789 of 3,821 rows. All 32
## disagreements run the same way -- carried TRUE where every count is zero --
## which is the carry-forward staleness, not a second definition. Rows that
## were previously blank resolve to FALSE, which is what the definition gives.

## --- why there is NO T6 backfill here ---------------------------------
## An earlier version of this script promoted genes to T6 when twas_sig /
## mr_sig / ctwas_sig were TRUE but no tier had been assigned. That was
## wrong. Those flags are carried forward from the PREVIOUS data.csv and
## tagged evidence_gene = "202605"; they are not produced by the release
## being built. Checked against out_20260917_fix: of the 36 genes that
## backfill promoted, 0 appear in this release's own
## res_AD_XWAS_MR_filtered_TWAS_sig_overlapADloci.csv.gz or
## res_AD_cTWAS_pip075_overlapADloci.csv.gz, while all 36 are present in
## res_adxub. So the tier chain did see them and correctly found no
## gene-level evidence to award T6 on.
## Genes with this release's TWAS/MR/cTWAS evidence (251 of them) are all
## already tiered, so the pipeline is internally consistent and the
## explorer now matches the workbook. Do not reinstate this without first
## confirming the evidence comes from the release being built.

## --- drop trans-CCA ---------------------------------------------------
## The CCA trans-program columns are carried through from the release
## directory but are not shown anywhere in the explorer; drop them so the
## delivered table matches what the app actually uses.
